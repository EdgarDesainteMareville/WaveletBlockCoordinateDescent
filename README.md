# WaveletBlockCoordinateDescent
A flexible Python implementation of Block Coordinate Descent algorithms on Wavelet blocks for image reconstruction.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

A minimal example of how to use the Block Coordinate Descent implementation can be found in `minimal.py`. This script demonstrates how to set up the problem, run the algorithm, and evaluate the results.

A small demo notebook is also provided in `demo.ipynb`.
